github repository (https://github.com/emacs-w3m/emacs-w3m).


* Required Emacs version changes

** Emacs-w3m no longer works with old Emacs versions.
Emacs-w3m supports the latest two major stable versions of Emacs.
Thus, when the latest stable Emacs was 26.1, Emacs-w3m was
supporting versions 26.1, 25.3, 25.2, and 25.1.

Older versions of Emacs may still be able to successfully use the
current version of emacs-w3m, but as the current versions of
Emacs or ELisp themselves change, deprecate, or remove features,
the latest version of emacs-w3m can be expected to keep pace,
and thus will gradually lose functionality when run in older
Emacs versions.

Pre-release versions of Emacs and even development snapshots are
unofficially supported, as we do try to keep the code up-to-date,
so if you are using a "bleeding edge" Emacs version and do
experience a problem, please do file a bug report by contacting
us on our mailing list!
