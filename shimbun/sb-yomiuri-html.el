;;; Commentary:

;; This module is now semi-obsolete.  You can use sb-yomiuri.el to read
;; html articles by putting the following line in your init file.
;;
;;(setq shimbun-yomiuri-prefer-text-plain nil)

;;; Code:

(require 'sb-yomiuri)

(luna-define-class shimbun-yomiuri-html (shimbun-yomiuri) ())

(defconst shimbun-yomiuri-html-prefer-text-plain nil
  "Non-nil means prefer text/plain articles rather than html articles.")

(provide 'sb-yomiuri-html)

;;; sb-yomiuri-html.el ends here
