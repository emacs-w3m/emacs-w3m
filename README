       This package contains emacs-w3m, an Emacs interface to w3m

1. Introduction

   w3m is a pager with WWW capability, developed by Akinori ITO.
   Although it is a pager, it can be used as a text-mode WWW browser.
   Visit the official w3m page for details:

       http://w3m.sourceforge.net/

   (See the next section `Requirements' for the place where you can get
    the latest w3m source.)

   Emacs-w3m is a simple Emacs interface to w3m.  Its official web page
   is available at:

        http://emacs-w3m.namazu.org/

   You can find more detailed version of the following explanations
   in the form of HTML'ized info:

        http://emacs-w3m.namazu.org/info/

   (But the info has not been being maintained for a long period,
    so some descriptions might have probably been obsolescent and
    the new features are not necessarily all described, sorry.)


2. Requirements

   Check whether your system meets the following requirements before
   installing emacs-w3m.

   Now emacs-w3m will work with Emacs 29, 30, and hopefully 31 (not
   released yet, though).

   Emacs-w3m requires the latest version of w3m (version 0.3.1 and
   later).  Since this program is much sensitive to the version of w3m,
   you should confirm it with `w3m --version' if you already have w3m
   installed.  To get the latest source of w3m, visit this page:

       https://salsa.debian.org/debian/w3m

   If you want to use the shimbun library that is included in the
   emacs-w3m distribution, you have to install the APEL and the FLIM
   packages in order.  To get those latest sources, visit this page:

       https://github.com/wanderlust/


3. Installation

3.1. Installing emacs-w3m on UNIX-like systems

     At the first, run the `configure' script.

         % ./configure

     If you can't find the `configure' script, rus the `autoconf'
     command. It create this script.

         % autoconf

     If you've installed APEL, FLIM or something in non-standard
     directories other than the default `load-path', you must specify
     them using the --with-addpath option as follows (this is the case
     where you want to use the shimbun library):

         % ./configure --with-addpath=/opt/share/apel:/opt/share/flim

     Next, execute the following commands to install emacs-w3m to an
     appropriate directory.

         % make
         % make install

     You may as well install icon image files, too.  To do this:

         % make install-icons
     or
         % make install-icons30

     The latter will install the slightly larger icons with characters.

     The info files will also be installed by `make install'.

3.2. Installing on non-UNIX-like systems

     If you cannot execute the `configure' script on your system, or if
     no `make' command is available, execute the following command:

         % emacs -batch -q -no-site-file -l w3mhack.el NONE -f w3mhack-nonunix-install

     If APEL, FLIM (or any other library) aren't installed in the
     ordinary places, the installer will leave them out.  In such a
     case, it is necessary to tell those places to the installer as
     shown below:

         % emacs -batch -q -no-site-file -l w3mhack.el //c/share/apel://c/share/flim -f w3mhack-nonunix-install


4. Configuration

   When you want to twiddle some options referenced by emacs-w3m, use
   the ~/.emacs-w3m.el file (its base name is the default value of the
   `w3m-init-file' variable, the name ~/.emacs-w3m is also allowed).
   That is similar to Emacs' init file (~/.emacs, etc.) but is read
   when emacs-w3m starts.  Note that there are a few options, e.g.,
   `w3m-command', that should be put into Emacs' init file, rather than
   the ~/.emacs-w3m.el file.


4.1. Essential Configuration

     Put this line into your Emacs' init file (i.e., ~/.emacs, etc.):

         (require 'w3m-load)

4.2. mime-w3m.el

     In order to let SEMI MUAs, such as Wanderlust, render text/html
     parts in messages using emacs-w3m, put the following line in your
     Emacs' init file (i.e., ~/.emacs, etc):

         (require 'mime-w3m)

4.3. Proxy Gateway

     There are some ways to do this, one is to set the "http_proxy"
     environment variable globally in the shell something like:

         export http_proxy='http://proxy.hogege.com:8000/'

     Another way is to customize the `w3m-command-arguments' variable
     so to have the option:

         '("-o" "http_proxy=http://PROXY_SERVER_NAME:PORT/")

     This can be done in your ~/.emacs-w3m.el file as shown below:

     (setq w3m-command-arguments
           (nconc w3m-command-arguments
                  '("-o" "http_proxy=http://proxy.hogege.com:8000/")))

     To specify `no-proxy' hosts, that shouldn't be connected to with
     proxy gateways, you can set the "no_proxy" environment variable
     with the comma separated host names, or set the
     `w3m-no-proxy-domains' variable with a list of domain names (not
     host names) as follows:

         (setq w3m-no-proxy-domains '("local.com" "neighbor.com"))

     See also the documentation for the `w3m-command-arguments-alist'
     variable to use regexps to specify the `no-proxy' hosts.


5. Contact the emacs-w3m community

   To contact the emacs-w3m community for reporting bugs, contributing
   improvements, making a suggestion or asking us for help, send a mail
   to the open list <emacs-w3m@namazu.org>.  You can also send a bug
   report using the `report-emacs-w3m-bug' command or the `C-c C-b' key
   if you have set the `mail-user-agent' variable so to work properly.


6. Acknowledgments
