       This package contains emacs-w3m, an Emacs interface to w3m

1. Introduction

   w3m[1][2][3] is a pager, developed by Akinori ITO, that can be used as a
   text-mode WWW browser. Emacs-w3m[4][5] uses w3m to browse the internet
   from within Emacs. The project's detailed Info manual is available for
   on-line viewing as HTML, here[6].

2. Requirements

2.1. Emacs versions

     Emacs-w3m supports the latest two major stable versions of Emacs. Thus, when the latest
     stable Emacs was 26.1, Emacs-w3m was supporting versions 26.1, 25.3, 25.2, and 25.1.

     Older versions of Emacs may still be able to successfully use the current version of
     emacs-w3m, but as the current versions of Emacs or ELisp themselves change, deprecate,
     or remove features, the latest version of emacs-w3m can be expected to keep pace, and
     thus will gradually lose functionality when run in older Emacs versions.

     Pre-release versions of Emacs and even development snapshots are unofficially supported,
     as we do try to keep the code up-to-date, so if you are using a "bleeding edge" Emacs
     version and do experience a problem, please do file a bug report by contacting us on our
     mailing list!

2.2. w3m

     Emacs-w3m requires the latest version of w3m.

2.3. apel and flim

     Optionally, if you would like to use the shimbun library included in the emacs-w3m
     distribution, you have to install the Emacs packages APEL and FLIM.

3. Installation

3.1. Installing emacs-w3m on UNIX-like systems

     At the first, run the `configure' script.

         % ./configure

     If you can't find the `configure' script, rus the `autoconf'
     command. It create this script.

         % autoconf

     Important notice to the Gnus users:
     ===================================
     If the various versions of Gnusae are installed in your system (it
     is likely that there are the released version and the development
     version of Gnusae), make sure that priority is given to the
     directory where the gnus.elc file which you use is installed in the
     load-path.  To do that, use the --with-addpath option as follows:

         % ./configure --with-addpath=/usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp/gnus

     If you've installed APEL, FLIM or something in non-standard
     directories other than the default `load-path', you must specify
     them using the --with-addpath option as follows (you may also
     include the Gnus directory being separated with `:' in it):

         % ./configure --with-addpath=/opt/share/apel:/opt/share/flim

     Next, execute the following commands to install emacs-w3m to an
     appropriate directory.

         % make
         % make install

     If you are using Emacs 21 or XEmacs, you had better install icon
     image files.  To do this:

         % make install-icons
     or
         % make install-icons30

     The latter will install the slightly larger icons with characters.

     You can also install emacs-w3m as an XEmacs package using
     `make install-package' instead of `make install'.

         % make
         % make install-package

     In this case, you don't have to execute `make install-icons' nor
     `make install-icons30'.

     The info files will also be installed by `make install' or
     `make install-package'.

3.2. Installing on non-UNIX-like systems

     If you cannot execute the `configure' script on your system, or if
     no `make' command is available, execute the following command:

         % emacs -batch -q -no-site-file -l w3mhack.el NONE -f w3mhack-nonunix-install

     If APEL, FLIM (or any other library) aren't installed in the
     ordinary places, the installer will leave them out.  In such a
     case, it is necessary to tell those places to the installer as
     shown below:

         % emacs -batch -q -no-site-file -l w3mhack.el //c/share/apel://c/share/flim -f w3mhack-nonunix-install


4. Configuration

   We recommend using the ~/.emacs-w3m file (which is the default
   value of `w3m-init-file') when you twiddle some variables of
   emacs-w3m.  This file is similar to ~/.emacs, but is read when
   emacs-w3m starts.  However, note that there are options which
   shouldn't be put there, for example, `w3m-command'.

4.1. Essential Configuration

     Put this line into your ~/.emacs file:

         (require 'w3m-load)

     You have nothing to do if you have emacs-w3m installed as an XEmacs
     package.

4.2. mime-w3m.el

     In order to handle text/html part with emacs-w3m under SEMI MUAs
     such as T-gnus and Wanderlust, you have to put the following line
     in your ~/.emacs file:

         (require 'mime-w3m)

4.3. Proxy Gateway

     There are some ways to do this, one is to set the "http_proxy"
     environment variable globally in the shell something like:

         setenv http_proxy http://proxy.hogege.com:8000/

     Another way is to customize the `w3m-command-arguments' variable to
     add the options "-o" and "http_proxy=http://PROXY_SERVER_NAME:PORT/".
     This can also be done in your ~/.emacs-w3m file as shown below:

        (setq w3m-command-arguments
              (nconc w3m-command-arguments
                     '("-o" "http_proxy=http://proxy.hogege.com:8000/")))

     To specify `no-proxy' hosts, which shouldn't be connected to with
     proxy gateways, you can set the "no_proxy" environment variable
     with the comma separated host names, or set the
     `w3m-no-proxy-domains' variable with a list of domain names (not
     host names) as follows:

         (setq w3m-no-proxy-domains '("local.com" "neighbor.com"))

     See also the documentation for the `w3m-command-arguments-alist'
     variable to use regexps to specify the `no-proxy' hosts.


5. Contact the emacs-w3m community

   The project maintains its repository on github[1], and separately
   operates an open email list [2]. You can also file bug reports using
   the `report-emacs-w3m-bug' command or the `C-c C-b' key if you have
   set the `mail-user-agent' variable that will work properly.
