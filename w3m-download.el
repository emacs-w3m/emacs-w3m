;;; Commentary:

;; This file provides download features for the `emacs-w3m' project.
;; Although the project is meant to be a front-end to the `w3m'
;; browser, this code uses elisp and, when available, external
;; back-end programs (currently just `wget') in order to offer
;; additional download features not native to `w3m':
;;
;;   + Partial downloads are stored on disk, not in memory (yes...).
;;
;;   + Resumption of partial downloads that were interrupted due to
;;     aborts or other failures.
;;
;;   + Bulk downloading of a buffer's links or region's links,
;;     selectable by regex and a presentation buffer. Throughout the
;;     code, this feature is referred to as `download-select'.
;;
;;   + The number of simultaneous downloads may be controlled, and can
;;     be dynamically changed.
;;
;;   + Downloads are queued, and the queue can be modified in
;;     real-time.
;;
;;   + Video downloads do not need actual download links, but can be
;;     scraped from web pages. This extension requires the external
;;     program `youtube-dl' (as is not limited to youtube).
;;
;;   + Downloads may be 'throttled' to limit bandwidth per download.
;;
;;   + Optional appending of meta-data to a download.
;;
;;     + Defcustom `w3m-download-save-metadata' controls whether
;;       downloaded `png' and `jpeg' files should have their link's
;;       "alt" caption is stored as meta-data element
;;       "Exif.Image.ImageDescription". Note that enabling this option
;;       will modify the file's checksum. This option currently uses
;;       `exif' and `exiv2' as external back-end programs.
;;
;;       Some ways to view from the command-line an embedded caption
;;       are:
;;
;;           exiv2 -g "Exif.Image.ImageDescription" foo.png
;;             exif --ifd=0 -t0x010e  foo.jpg |grep value
;;
;;     + Defcustom `w3m-download-enable-xattr' controls whether to
;;       save a file's original URL and Referer HTTP header value.
;;       This feature uses the `wget' `--xattr' argument and thus
;;       requires that the save-path be on a file-system that supports
;;       extended attributes.
;;
;;       Be aware that the URL might contain private information like
;;      access tokens or credentials.
;;
;;   + Individual detailed download progress logs in dedicated
;;     buffers, automatically deleted upon successful completion.
;;
;;   + A single central buffer to view all downloads in all states
;;     (queued, running, paused, failed, and completed), act on them,
;;     and see their details. The buffer includes a summary statistics
;;     line.
;;
;;     + Downloads can be paused, resumed, and removed.
;;
;;     + The category order of the display can be easily customized.
;;
;;     + Dedicated faces for each download category.
;;
;;   + Download links that are 'hidden' within HTML source code inside
;;     <script> elements or other places can optionally be used. See
;;     variable `w3m-download-select-deep-search'.
;;
;;   + Downloads with commonly duplicated names can be uniquified to
;;     user-meaningful file-names. See variable
;;     `w3m-download-ambiguous-basename-alist'.

;; This file also absorbed most of the legacy download functions,
;; those which were basically wrappers for `w3m-download', to keep all
;; (most) functionality in one place. The functions and defcustom not
;; moved here are:
;;
;;   --FILE--
;;   mew-w3m.el    mew-w3m-ext-url-fetch (dummy url)
;;   w3m.el        w3m-external-view (url &optional no-cache handler)
;;   w3m-lnum.el   w3m-lnum-actions-image-alist
;;   w3m-lnum.el   w3m-lnum-save-image ()

;;; Dependencies:

;; w3m-util   ; for ??
;; key-assist ; for key-assist


;;; Usage:

;; From anywhere within `emacs-w3m' you can get a combination context
;; help and command launcher:
;;
;;     `w3m-download-help'
;;
;; For downloading single items at point, there exist multiple
;; functions that seem redundant:
;;
;;     `w3m-download-this-url'       (legacy)
;;     `w3m-download-this-image'     (legacy)
;;     `w3m-save-image'              (legacy)
;;     `w3m-download-video'          (uses `youtube-dl')
;;     `w3m-download-video-at-point' (uses `youtube-dl')
;;     `w3m-download-using-wget'
;;     `w3m-download-using-w3m'      (not recommended)
;;     `w3m-download'
;;
;; For downloading more than one link in a buffer or region:
;;
;;     `w3m-download-select'
;;
;; At any time, you can change the number of allowable
;; simultaneous downloads:
;;
;;     `w3m-download-increase-simultaneous'
;;     `w3m-download-decrease-simultaneous'
;;
;;     This is easiest done from a w3m-download-select buffer,
;;     where the functions are bound to the +/- keys.
;;
;; The current recommended way to kill a download in progress is
;; to kill its progress buffer. To kill all current downloads:
;;
;;     `w3m-download-delete-all-download-buffers'
;;     `w3m-download-kill-all-wget-processes'      (just an alias)
;;
;;     There also exists for now a slightly different function
;;     that was originally intended as a possible hook function:
;;
;;         `w3m-download-kill-all-asociated-processes'
;;
;; The download queue can be examined in a special buffer that allows
;; one to delete or change the order of items:
;;
;;     `w3m-download-view-queue'
;;
;;     This function is intended to be bound to keybinding `S-C-y' in
;;     a nod to what seems standard in many modern browsers. You can
;;     manually bind the function by evaluating:
;;
;;     (define-key w3m-mode-map [(shift ctrl y)] 'w3m-download-view-queue)
;;     (define-key w3m-mode-map "Y"              'w3m-download-view-queue)
;;
;;
;;     The buffer auto-refreshes every `w3m-download-refresh-interval'
;;     seconds (default 16), but you can always force a refresh using
;;     `w3m-download-refresh-buffer' (`C-g'), and you can change the
;;     value using `w3m-download-set-refresh-interval' (`C-u C-g').
;;
;; The download resumption behavior is controlled by variable
;; `w3m-download-resume' to either auto-restart them, pause them, or
;; start with a clean empty slate.



;;; TODO:

;; + branch w3m-history-scrub needs now to shred
;;   `w3m-download-save-file'.
;;
;; + Easier way to find a particular download to kill
;;
;; + function: w3m-download-select-exec
;;
;;   + pre-screen the list of downloads for possible name conflicts
;;     with existing files, and duplicates, and prompt the user
;;     accordingly.
;;
;;     + maybe do this instead when creating the select buffer, ie.
;;       gray out entries that already exist on the queue
;;
;;   + this should be done for downloads outside of select-exec also
;;
;;
;; + `w3m--download-check-and-use-cache'
;;
;;   + does not emulate `w3m-download-enable-xattr'
;;
;; + add hooks for quitting emacs-w3m
;;
;;   + this might not be necessary. the current method using the save
;;     and load list may be sufficient.
;;
;; + feature creep: None of these-items are necessary. At some point
;;   the project could consider turning to an external program which
;;   specializes in downloading, but anyway ...
;;
;;   + add an annotation field in lists, to be a visible comment that
;;     a user can make on a download record.
;;
;;   + apply certain command upon a region, ie. more than one download
;;     at a time. This has posed problematic for me because although
;;     `transient-mark-mode' is non-nil, `region-active-p' always
;;     returns nil, so I haven't been able to get region commands to
;;     work (see programming note in-line below). Anyway, here are
;;     candidates for commands on which to apply regions:
;;
;;      + move position in queue
;;
;;      + toggle details
;;
;;      + toggle pause
;;
;;      + delete lines / entries
;;
;;   + an alist of extensions and metadata commands
;;
;;   + an alist of download commands (eg. aria2, curl, axel)
;;
;;   + offloading to a dedicated downloader (eg. uget)
;;
;;   + persistence across crashes (ie. maintain a disk file)
;;
;;   + renice download processes
;;
;;   + delete a partially downloaded file when manually aborted
;;     (eg. when killing the progress buffer)
;;
;;   + use the process-fiter function to add detail to each download.
;;
;;   + Think about the need / desirability of hook functions to
;;     optionally kill running downloads, for `kill-emacs-hook'
;;     (without user interaction), `kill-emacs-query-functions'
;;     (with user interaction), and the mode exit hook for
;;     `emacs-w3m' (look it up, what is it?). Maybe there should
;;     also be download recovery/resume/re-attach hooks for either
;;     `after-init-hook', `emacs-startup-hook' or the startup hook
;;     for `emacs-w3m' (look it up, what is it?)
